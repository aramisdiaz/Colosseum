## Introduction

            The game is a turn based fighting game.

            Much like a traditional turn based strategy game, players take turns when playing and are able to
            perform a certain set of actions on their turn.

            Once a person sees the main menu they are able to choose between several weapons and trinkets,
            before they can proceed to the main gameplay.

            The weapons and weapon attacks are broken down into elemental damage categories.



## Weapons:


            Phlegestos, The Sword Of Flames (Boosts Attack) Fire

            It is unknown who forged the great Sword of Flames. Some say Hephaestus, others the Dark Lord himself.
            What is known is the devastating abilities it has and its devouring flame that burns opponents to cinders.
            Out of all the weapons, this is truly the hardest to master, let alone wield.


            Tidus, The Spear Of Ocean (Boosts Defense) Water

            Neptune forged the Legendary Spear of Ocean deep in the bowels of the sea. Imbued with all the rage and fury
            of the stormy seas and great typhoons, it requires a strong user to bend its aquatic fortitude to their
            will.

            Acceleron, The Bow Of Wind (Boosts Agility) Air

            Apollo has been attributed as the maker of this mighty weapon, however whether this is true or a fabrication
            has been lost to timeâ€¦ The range it employs combined with its magical abilities can create a truly
            devastating crescendo of onslaught.


            Terragos, The Axe Of Land (Boosts Vigor) Earth

            The shield of earth was forged by the earth mother gaia herself to defend the planet against any who seek to
            destroy it. More defensive then offensive the shield can wielded as a powerful tool by one whose resolve is
            as strong as mountains.



## Accessories:

            Gauntlet Of Smoldering Embers
            

            Shield of Waves
         

            Amulet of the Sun
            

            Ring of the Winds

            

## Gameplay

            Each character that is made has one weapon and one accesory, but both cannot be from the same element
            (example fire and fire).

            How damage is dealt is essentially like rock paper scissors, and is allotted in the following way:
       

            Earth damage does double damage against air
            Air damage does double damage against water
            Water damage does double damage against fire
            Fire damage does double damage against earth


            Choose wisely, as your weapon and trinket combination choice will impact how well a player does in their
            match.



            The left and right buttons present your methods of attack. The element you attack with will then become the
            one you defend with on your opponent's turn.


            Two buttons based on the weapon or element you chose and you can choose to attack by clicking either of
            those buttons D8+ attack, reduced by the opponents defense.


            There is also a chance to miss, D20 vs. the opponents armor class ((agility + defense/2) + 10)

            If you meet or beat the AC you land the hit and do the damage.

            Other player (the computer) then has their turn

            After their turn commences it goes back to you to do actions.

            Gameplay resumes back and forth until a players health (vigor*5) is reduced to zero

            Health = vigor * 5

            Get your opponent's health to zero and you progress to the next round!

            Reach the finals and you may face the Dark Lord himself...
            

### Now go forth, and test your might!
