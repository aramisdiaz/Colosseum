    <h1>How to Play</h1>


<p>The game is primarily a turn based fighting game.

    Much like a traditional turn based strategy game, players take turns when playing and are able to perform a certain set of actions on their turn.
    
    Once a person sees the main menu they are able to choose between several weapons and trinkets, before they can proceed to the main gameplay.
    
    The weapons and weapon attacks are broken down into elemental damage categories.
    
    Weapons:
    
    The Shield of Earth 
    
    (Defense, tanky) earth
    
    The shield of earth was forged by the earth mother gaia herself to defend the planet against any who seek to destroy it. More defensive then offensive the shield can wielded as a powerful tool by one who’s resolve is as strong as mountains.
    
    The Bow Of Wind (ranged, int) air
    
    Apollo has been attributed as the maker of this mighty weapon, however whether this is true or a fabrication has been lost to time… The range it employs combined with it’s magical abilities can create a truly devastating crescendo of onslaught.
    
    The Sword Of Ocean (middle of the road, str) water
    
    Neptune forged the sword of water deep in the bowels of the ocean. Imbued with all the rage and fury of the stormy seas and great typhoons, it requires a strong user to bend it’s aquatic fortitude to their will
    
    The Spear Of Fire (agility, fast paced combat, weak on defense) fire
    
    It is unknown who forged the great spear of fire. Some say Hephaestus, others the Dark Lord himself. What is known is the devastating abilities it has and it’s devouring flame that burns opponents to cinders. Out of all the weapons, this is truly the hardest master, let alone wield. 
    
    Trinkets:
    
    Ring of earth
    
    Necklace of the sun
    
    Armguard of waves
    
    Handwraps Of Smoldering Embers 
    
    Each character that is made, has one weapon and one accesory, but both cannot be from the same element (example fire and fire).
    
    How damage is dealt is essentially like rock paper scissors, and is allotted in the following way:
    
    Earth damage does double damage against air
    Air damage does double damage  against water
    Water damage does double damage against fire
    Fire damage does double damage against earth
    
    Choose wisely, as your weapon and trinket combination choice will impact how well a player does in their match.
    
    The mouse left and right button clicks are how you attack. The buttons then become how you defend on your opponent's turn. 
    
    Whatever element you attack with, you defend with on your opponent's turn.
    
    Two buttons based on the weapon or element you chose and you can choose to attack by clicking either of those buttons D8+ attack, reduced by the opponents defense.
    
    There is also a chance to miss, D20 vs. the opponents armor class (agility + defense/2 +10 (13 roughly)
    
    If you beat a 13 you land the hit and do the damage.
    
    Other player (the computer) then has their turn
    
    After their turn commences it goes back to you to do actions.
    
    Gameplay resumes back and forth until a players health( vigor*5) is reduced to zero
    
    Health vigor *5 
    
    Get your opponent to zero and you win!
    
    Now test your might!</p>
