      <h1>Duel of Coders</h1>

    <p>Due to the outbreak of Coronavirus, you have been furloughed. In an attempt to get sustainable income after the extra $600 on your funemployment runs out at the end of the month, you have decided to register in a coding class in an attempt at a lucrative career change.</p>      
    <p>To prepare, you decide to go to your local library and find a book on coding basics. “The Art Of The Code” catches your eye. You open the book and begin reading. The first line states “You who read this, should you be worthy, shall be chosen.” A flash of light instantly transports you to another world. </p>
    <p>You open your eyes. Before you stands a figure wearing a black cloak, hiding his face except for two red glowing eyes on a throne comprised of random node.js functions. Next to him sits a massive demonic looking Chihuahua with a name tag on his Spiked collar that reads “Samuel Jackson.”</p>
    <p>The figure speaks: “I am The Dark Lord Schri. You have been summoned here to fight in the Coding Colosseum Tournament.  Choose from these pre-rendered items, defeat your opponents, and prove your might. Should you succeed, you may return to your world. Fail and be sent to the backend of github for all eternity. Now choose your weapon…”</p>
    <p>Test your might!</p>
